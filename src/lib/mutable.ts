/**
 * Creates a store wrapping a mutable `value`.
 * Useful for values that are expensive to copy, like large `Map`s,
 * and values that cannot be cloned, like `WeakMap`s,
 * in combination with the Svelte `immutable` compiler flag.
 *
 * Typical usage mutates `value` inside the `mutator` callback, which has no return value.
 * Calling `mutate` with no callback triggers a change,
 * which is useful if `value` is mutated elsewhere,
 * but that's usually discouraged for readability reasons.
 *
 * To avoid unnecessary garbage creation,
 * the implementation swaps between two stable object references.
 * This breaks composability with code that
 * expects immutable references on every store change,
 * which may cause some surprising issues,
 * but given that the store value is mutated,
 * it's probably an issue only in rare cases.
 * If you don't need to mutate the store value, prefer a normal `writable` store.
 * The sibling module "safeMutable" version of this store
 * creates a new wrapper object on every change.
 *
 * @param value {any}
